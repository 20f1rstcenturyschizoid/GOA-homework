    <p> G.O.A was founded on 12.04.2022 (I believe) by a software engineer, MMA fighter and programmer, Nika Keshelava.
        G.O.A was created as a fun, but importantly, effective way of giving young Georgian children an outlet to express
        their creative learning desires, in many forms, which G.O.A covers very well, as it isn't just a programming school.</p>
        <p> G.O.A also offers MMA and Cinematography courses. Unlike most academies or schools, G.O.A focuses on supporting their students
        by establishing a connective relationship with them, instead of a simple "teacher-student" relationship between the teachers and students,
        in ways that aren't very common in traditional schools, such as:
    </p>
    <h2>#1 Encouraging excersise.</h2>
    <p> While schools typically have physical education as a lesson, most of the time, the "education" part is the more focused aspect, rather than the actual
        "physical" "education".</p>
        <p> However, in G.O.A, this isn't the case, as it's very recommended for students to do pushups, squats, planks, and other types of
        excersies, both during lessons (mostly during the breaks), and also outside of lessons, so as to develop a healthy lifestyle (as coding is very computer oriented, it's extremely important to find a balance between computer-excercise and physical excercise.)
    </p>
    <h2> #2 Helping students to develop a positive mindset</h2>
    <p> In G.O.A, the main focus isn't to just teach and force knowledge into a student's mind, unlike most traditional schools (that also come with strict teachers).</p>
    <p> In G.O.A, one of the main focuses is to teach kids to have a positive mentality. Students are personally talked to by their group leaders, and noobody is singled out. Individuality shines in G.O.A, but teamwork is also indespensible.
        Competition is a core aspect of G.O.A, but everybody works together, and helps eachother out, as mentioned previously. Students do not have simply have student-student relationships, we are all friends, as G.O.A also encourages unity in our individuality, no matter what. </p>
        <h2>#3: Relatability.</h2>
        <p>One more thing that also sets G.O.A apart is that it's easily able to connect with younger students (a majority in G.O.A, due to the field being studied) and does not feel unknown for them. This is because, unlike traditional schools, G.O.A has dedicated channels for social hangouts between students (even if from different groups), and channels for "memes", which are a humorous way of putting a joke, or a funny mmoment in an image to be shared online between said peers.</p>
    <h2> 4: My personal experience with G.O.A</h2>
    <p> Now, this isn't an objective reason. It's more subjective, and despite all the personality and positives G.O.A offers, some will disagree with me, but I think that's unlikely.</p>
    <p> Admittedly, I cannot say I've been with G.O.A for years, only a couple weeks. Howeer, whatever amount of time it may have been since I signed up for G.O.A, I can't say it been anything but positive.</P>
        <p> My mentor, one Luka Gurgenidze, is someone I especially have to give credit to, as his teaching is something I found extremely effective, considering in less than three weeks, he's given me a good general idea of what to expect from programming, and not to mention, do it in a way that is entertaining, and fun to listen to.</p>
        <p> I know this, because I've never been a good listener. I'm not the greatest at verbal instructions, unless something really intrigues me, which his teaching has done for me, as it shows, and I'm grateful for that.</p>
        <p>I'd also like to say the same for my group leader, one Merab Jiqidze, He's a great person, as is with almost everybody enrolled in G.O.A, and he cares for our group as much as we care for him, and we are all appreciative of September 29th, the first time we tuned into a lesson. You could tell, everybody, me included, was nervous for the first lesson, but he assured us and gave us confidence, that it would be alright, and I personally am thankful. </p>
    <h2> There's a million other reasons why YOU should sign up for G.O.A, but there's too many to list here, so come and see for yourself. We'll be expecting you!</h2>
