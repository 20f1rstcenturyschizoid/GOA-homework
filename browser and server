A browser is an application that allows for you to see both front-end and back-end code developed into a website, such as YouTube, even the Google search bar itself, etc etc.
It's something that reads HTML, CSS and JS code, and turns it into something that we can interact with or watch videos on.
A server on the other thand is where information is sent, recieved, and contained. A server sends requests for example, for a person to access
a certain part of a website after having the user input their password while signing in, and such.
