    <h2> The types of coding languages:</h2>

    <h3>1: Python</h3>

    <h4> Python is widely recognized as the easiest gateway to learn programming and later on, other programming languages.</h4>
    <h4>Python first appeared on the 20th of February, 1991 (34 years ago), by a man named Guido van Rossum, of whom you can find more information in the following link.</h3>
    
    <h3>2: HTML</h3>
    <h4>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a language that was released in 1993, 32 years ago, and was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, alongside WHATWG.</h4>


    <h3>The primary use for HTML is to create the baseline foundation for website development. However, only HTML cannot be used to create a fully equipped website, which leads into my next point:</h3>
    <h2>CSS & JavaScript</h2>
    <h3> Css (Cascading Style Sheets), created by W3C, released on the 17th of December, 1998 (26 years ago) is a programming language used alongside HTML and JavaScript, and it's main function is to give the website that is being developed more style, via animations, colors, and other details.</h3>
    <h3>JavaScript, developed by Brendan Eich, released on the 4th of December, 1995, serves as a way to give functionality to the websites, finally completeing the building, designing, and polishing of websites. It's what makes clicking a button, for example, to actually do something, instead of having simply clicked a button. </h3>
