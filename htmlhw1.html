<h1>A brief introduction into me and my interests</h1>
<h2>1: Music</h2>
<h3>I'm somebody who, like most people, enjoys listening music, to pass the time or to de-stress. Some of my favorite artists are people I'm sure almsot everybody has heard of, notably Kanye West.</h3>
<h2>2: Sport</h2>
<h3>Also a fairly common interest, notably the sport of football. As is with all football fans, we all have different teams that we support till the end. For me, that team is Borussia Dortmund. I've been a fan since 2011, during their UCL run, and I've stuck with them since. I can't say that I'm a football fanatic, or that I know alot of football-related trivia, but I like to think I know a decent amount about the sport.</h3>
<h2>3: Coding</h2>
<h3>Last but not least, obviously, coding. I've always been fascianted by the thought of understanding how the clockwork behind websites and games worked, and I've always wanted to create my own, I feel as if it would make me feel a bit accomplished knowing I could look at a solid website and think, "yeah, I made that". And, I know that studying with GOA, I'll be able to do so as long as I never let up the pursuit.</h3>
<h2>That's all, for now, until I make a more detailed post when I understand how to create a fully-fledged website of my own. See ya! :)</h2>
<h5>(Oh, and I'll include images too next time, I just don't know how to right now. It's boring without some more personality.)</h5>
